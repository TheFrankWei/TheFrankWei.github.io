This is my refactored personal portfolio! For old code, refer to https://github.com/TheFrankWei/TheFrankWei.github.io---OLD (difference between the two is this one uses hooks for most components, still in the process of refactoring everything)

##TODO:

- [ ] refactor UI for portfolio items
- [ ] add Website themes using Redux (?)
- [ ] add more cool animations
- [ ] reimplement breakpoints
